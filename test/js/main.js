/*Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. Famous examples include "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Amor, Roma", "race car", " stack cats","step on no pets","taco cat", " put it up", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" and "No 'x' in Nixon".

Using your favorite programming language, write a small function to check if a passed String is a palindrome or not.

Example:

IsPalindrome("Anita lava la tina") returns true
IsPalindrome("Anita lava la ropa") returns false
IsPalindrome("Ana") returns true
Write a program which accepts an array of 3 integers and sort them in ascending order.
*/
//input your code






/*
Example:

1) if input array is [ 39, 26, 28]  then 
output will be 26, 28, 39.

2) if input array is [3934, 2426, 4628 ] then 
output will be 2426 3934 4628.
Write a program to takes input two matrix(3*3) array and calculate the multiplication of both matrix.
*/
//input your code




/*
Example :

1. If two matrix are :
Matrix 1st :
4 4 4
2 2 2
3 3 3
Matrix 2nd :
1 4 3
3 2 4
1 2 4
then the multiplication of both matrix will be:
20 32 44
10 16 22
15 24 33

Notice that: 
20 = 4 * 1 + 4 * 3 + 4 * 1
10 = 2 * 1 + 2 * 3 + 2 * 1
15 = 3 * 1 + 3 * 3 + 3 * 1
Write a program which takes integer number and prints the table of this number.
*/
//input your code





/*
Example :

1.If user gives input 2 then output table should be in this format :
2*1 = 2
2*2 = 4
2*3 = 6
2*4 = 8
2*5 = 10
2*6 = 12
2*7 = 14
2*8 = 16
2*9 = 18
2*10 = 20

2.If user gives input 4 then output table should be in this format:
4*1 = 4
4*2 = 8
4*3 = 12
4*4 = 16
4*5 = 20
4*6 = 24
4*7 = 28
4*8 = 32
4*9 = 36
4*10 = 40
